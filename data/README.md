# Data Folder

This folder is intended to store datasets used in this project. Every file placed inside this folder is ignored by Git, except for the README.md file.

> Only placeholder dataset will be added here in the future. 

### Labeling Process Guide

The following steps outline the labeling process used to prepare the dataset:

1. **Visual Inspection**: Defects were identified by visually inspecting images of the chips.
2. **Binary Label Assignment**:
    - **Defect (1)**: Assigned to chips with any kind of anomaly, including minor ones.
    - **No Defect (0)**: Assigned to chips that are perfectly fine with no visible anomalies.
