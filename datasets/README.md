# Data Folder

This folder is intended to store datasets used in this project. Every file placed inside this folder is ignored by Git, except for the README.md file.

> Only placeholder dataset (labelled) are included. You need to use `labeling/process-labeling.py` to generate the full dataset.


#### To do:

- Change the labeling names for a full path, instead of just the id of the image. Because we can have the same id for different images, in different folders.
