# ML-project-2

- [Labeling Instructions](labeling/README.md)
- [Datasets Information](datasets/README.md)
- [Source Code](src)

We still need to write more documentation here.
And write the README.md here, and also inside the labeling folder.


Start explaining:
 1. go to datasets and process
 2. go to src and run evals
 3. go to src and run inference with sahi in the web
 4. go to src and run training


Now we also can explain how we labeled the data in `labeling/README.md`...
